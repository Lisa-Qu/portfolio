        <h1>🏃‍♀️ My Identity as a Runner</h1>
        <p class="lead">From Shanghai sprinting lanes to California trails, hurdling taught me courage, rhythm, and how to stay grounded in every season of life.</p>

      <div class="blog-body">
        <p>I was once the <strong>Shanghai 100-meter Women’s Hurdles Champion</strong> during my junior and senior school years.<br>
          I am also a <strong>National Level II Athlete</strong> in both <strong>100-meter hurdles</strong> and <strong>100-meter sprint</strong>.<br>
          I started learning hurdles in <strong>third grade</strong>, when my parents simply wanted me to build a habit of exercising.<br>
          Fortunately, with the guidance of my coaches — <strong>Liou Tang, Shuping Han, and Director Fang</strong> — I later trained under <strong>Haiping Sun</strong>, the national coach who also trained <strong>Liu Xiang</strong>, China’s first Olympic gold medalist in the men’s 110-meter hurdles.</p>
        <h2>🥇 Facing Fear and Learning Courage</h2>
        <p>I began hurdling in <strong>Grade 5</strong>. At first, I was terrified of the hurdles.<br>
          During winter training, I fell almost every day — crashing into the hurdles and rolling across the track.<br>
          Luckily, the thick winter clothes protected my body, but not my confidence.<br>
          Each time I approached a hurdle, I jumped too high, afraid of getting hurt.</p>
        <p>Later, I realized I had some natural talent for this sport.<br>
          Watching Olympic replays, I noticed that even top athletes often knock down hurdles — <strong>seven out of ten times!</strong><br>
          Then it clicked: what matters is not avoiding the hurdle, but <strong>maintaining speed</strong>.<br>
          If you stay low and fast, hitting a hurdle doesn’t slow you down much.<br>
          From that moment, I learned that <strong>fear never helps — only facing and flowing through obstacles does</strong>.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>🧠 Technique, Reflection, and Growth</h2>
        <p>When I became the <strong>Shanghai 100-meter hurdles champion</strong>, I met <strong>Coach Haiping Sun</strong>, the legendary mentor of Liu Xiang.<br>
          Training with him changed how I understood athletics.<br>
          I realized that my strength wasn’t only physical — it was also <strong>mental</strong>.<br>
          Hurdles demand both <strong>technique and reflection</strong>, not just endurance.</p>
        <p>Coach Sun constantly reminded me of precision:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Send your hips forward, whip your leg down instantly!”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That movement — quick, sharp, and rhythmic — minimized speed loss and kept me gliding.</p>
        <p>From Coach Sun, I learned that <strong>mastery comes from learning the same thing through different perspectives</strong> — every teacher shapes a unique part of who you become.</p>
        <h2>⚖️ Balance between Study and Running</h2>
        <p>I didn’t have good grades in primary school, but athletic training taught me how to improve.<br>
          Because I had limited time to study, I tried every possible way to finish my homework before school ended — even during breaks.<br>
          I also found that exercising was a great way to refresh my mind and stay focused.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>💪 New Passions</h2>
        <p>Now, I enjoy <strong>hiking, boxing, TRX, and weight training</strong> — not for medals, but for strength, clarity, and joy.</p>
